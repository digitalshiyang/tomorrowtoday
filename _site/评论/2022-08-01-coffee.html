                    <p><strong>Introduction</strong>
<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coffee and Cigarettes, what a combination.” Iggy Pop</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The program focuses on sponsored films about coffee and cigarettes in the US, UK, and Europe. More specifically, my thoughts are to question how the films use various approaches to attract, persuade, or educate the youth. The selection doesn’t attempt to represent the full spectrum of the genre, which would be impossible, but to highlight a few instances the interaction is intriguing and inspiring. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Coffee and cigarette commercials are as old as sponsored film itself. Admiral Cigarette (1897), one of the earliest commercials, casts four men in stereotypical clothes representing John Bull, a Native American, and Uncle Sam and a female smoker who distributes the cigarettes to unfold the banner “we all smoke”. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Many of the sponsored films take shape of or allude to other well-known genres. The program includes films that are inspired by travelogue, documentary, as well as public service announcements. They sometimes intentionally mislead the audience to believe they belong to the borrowed genre. The moment of revelation is always amusing.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Finally, due to health concerns, cigarette commercials are as popular as they are controversial. Health departments have produced educational films that target children and youth against smoking. I also included one unusual anti-smoking film in the program, which takes the disguise of pro-smoking. <br /></p>

<p><strong>Program: Total 52 minutes</strong><br /><br /></p>

    <p><strong>PSA: John Waters Doesn’t Want You to Smoke</strong>, Academy Film Archive, 1 minute<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VzSiilYSKs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VzSiilYSKs</a><br />Scanned from a 35mm print held by Academy Film Archive. <br /><br />“I’m supposed to announce that there’s no smoking in this theater, which is just one of the most ridiculous things I’ve heard of in my life.” John Waters speaks to the camera while taking a sip of his cigarette. He continues, “it gives usher jobs, if people don’t smoke, there will be no employment for the youth of today.” <br /><br />The idiosyncratic director performed this “PSA” for the Nuart Theatre at Los Angeles out of appreciation for their long-time screening of his infamous Pink Flamingos. The trailer remains a popular preshow for arthouses and revival cinemas around the world.  Although the film is not sponsored by a commercial entity, it embodies the qualities advertisers always associate with cigarettes, transgression, adventure, and a devil-may-care spirit. <br /><br /></p>

    <p><strong>Bli med på motorsykkeltur over Besseggen (1932)</strong>, Norway National Library, 3 minutes<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqTn7qEX_Ko">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqTn7qEX_Ko</a><br />Production Company: Wilse Film Co., <br />Sponsor: Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik. <br />Date: 29.07.1932. <br />fonte/source: Nasjonalbiblioteket, Oslo/Mo i Rana.<br /><br />Labeled as a “natural film”, Bli med på motorsykkeltur over Besseggen only reveals its agenda until the last minute. The camera follows a daredevil motorcyclist who goes on an expedition around the rough edge of Besseggen mountain ridge. As we enjoy the breathtaking landscape, our protagonist pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pockets and distributes them to other adventurers. <br /><br />The film is one of a series of nature travelogues commissioned by Norwegian tobacco company Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik made between 1929 to 1937, each depicting the attractions of a specific region. The series incorporates Norwegian scenery and elements of expedition film, both of which were popular in Norwegian cinema in the 1920s. <br /><br /></p>

    <p><strong>Too Tough to Care (1964)</strong>, Indiana University Bloomington, 19 minutes<br /><a href="https://media.dlib.indiana.edu/media_objects/d791sh65v">https://media.dlib.indiana.edu/media_objects/d791sh65v</a><br />Production: Lawren Productions<br />Director/Writer: Dave Parker<br />Sponsor: Marin Medical Society, California Medical Association<br /><br />Sponsored by Marin Medical Society and California Medical Association, the film takes the satirist approach to the subject. Dismayed by the successful anti-smoking campaign of medical associations, a fictional cigarette company comes up with the “too tough to care” tagline to persuade young people to disregard the danger of smoking. Although the smoking campaign is successful, the audience finally discovers the executives at the company are non-smokers. <br />Too Tough to Care educates the audience of the danger of believing in advertising. The satirical approach was lauded by reviewers at the time. Too Tough to Care was distributed under the “addiction” section of the Film Reference Guide for Medicine and Applied Sciences in 1968 and used in teenager smoking prevention programs in 1980. <br /><br /></p>

    <p><strong>Good Strong Coffee (1968)</strong>, British Film Institute, 2 minutes<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozxZCENVaVE&amp;list=PLXvkgGofjDzh0Fg5odZ9LNFNtWFJwBbUw&amp;index=29">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozxZCENVaVE&amp;list=PLXvkgGofjDzh0Fg5odZ9LNFNtWFJwBbUw&amp;index=29</a><br />Production Co.: Battey, Barton, Durstine, and Osborne.<br /><br />According to this 1968 ad, the secret to the groovy London nightlife is the hot black stuff. Hipsters dressed in the latest fashion swinging in liquid projection until midnight only stopped to have more coffee. The next day they wake up in the Thames-side flat, drinking good strong coffee in the sunset. The message is clear: coffee is the true stimulus of the youth.<br /><br />Not much is known about the film, including its copyright owner, which leads BFI to categorize it as an orphan film. The absence of coffee brand names also adds to the mystery of the film.  <br /><br /></p>
  </li>

    <p><strong>Coffee House Rendezvous (1966)</strong>, National Film Preservation Foundation, 27 minutes<br /><a href="https://www.filmpreservation.org/sponsored-films/screening-room/coffee-house-rendezvous-1966#">https://www.filmpreservation.org/sponsored-films/screening-room/coffee-house-rendezvous-1966#</a><br />Sponsor: Coffee Information Service. <br />Production Co.: Ted Steeg Productions. <br />Director/Writer: Ted Steeg. <br />Scanned from a 16mm print held by the Library of Congress. <br /><br />“In a coffee house, coffee is no longer just a beverage, it becomes a social catalyst.” declared Kalman B. Druck, who works under the National Coffee Association for Think Coffee campaign, which promoted nonprofit coffee houses around churches and campuses. The quote is the perfect tagline for Coffee House Rendezvous, the 27-minute documentary-style program made to publicize the campaign. The film profiles seven coffee houses to show the positive changes the public places brought to the youth communities. <br /><br />The film was initially broadcasted on Channel 11 in 1966. The editor, Mark Rappaport, has a career as a prolific underground filmmaker. The film was produced in Eastmancolor but survived as a black-and-white 16mm print.</p>
