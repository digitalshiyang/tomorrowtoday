I"˘<p><em>Berberian Sound Studio</em> explored the often-assumed synchronicity between what we are seeing on the screen and what we are hearing. It is precisely the asynchronicity that leads to fantasy, beauty, as well as horror and cruelty. <br /><br /></p>

<p>The film shows image before sound. Whether it is the face of an actor or a shot of cabbage, every time it feels like a small mystery unfolding between two shots. I‚Äôm particular drawn to the human faces. The sharp lighting stresses the features. Opened mouth and intense eyes. What do they sound like? This delay between sound and image builds the tension of the film and intrigues the audience. <br /><br /></p>

<p>The trick was extended by Strickland to play with the conception of the mechanical and natural sound. In the film, the two are often mixed, or deliberately confused. In one scene, we hear the screaming voice  before the actual person entered the sound studio and exclaimed ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you can change my voice so much‚Äù. The playful joke deliberately targets the innocent audience who take for granted the voice we hear are naturally produced. <br /><br /></p>

<p>The blurred line between what the audience are hearing and what is actually on screen also play into the story of the film. The audience are denied access to the actual film that the actors were scoring for. When we finally reach the end, we realized the horror was actually always with us throughout. The cruelty is not on the screen but actually behind the screen.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Ultimately, the assumed synchronicity between sound and image never existed in cinema. The sound we hear are never from the image we see on screen. The ironic scenes of sound production, such tearing cabbages to score the gore, are result of post-production work for <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em>. Between the banal sound production process and sensational visual we‚Äôre left imaging, the film plays with the audience‚Äôs extreme appetite for the visual and the desire to escape from the reality.</p>
